Objective:
Simulate the google's homepage visual aspect, with none of the functionality.

Self-assesment:
Managed to do the layout and positioning on my own, but I had to inspect Google's home page for the details about some colors, padding and margins.
Overall I am quite satisfied with the amount of information I was able to recall and use effectively from the previous lessons on The Odin Project, in spite of being a very small project.
